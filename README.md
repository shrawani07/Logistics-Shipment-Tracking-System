# ðŸšš Logistics & Shipment Tracking System (Salesforce Project)

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
In the logistics and transportation industry, companies face significant challenges in managing shipments and providing real-time visibility to customers. Shipments often pass through multiple checkpoints, and without a centralized system, it becomes difficult to track delivery progress accurately. Customers frequently remain uninformed about the current status of their packages, leading to dissatisfaction, increased customer service calls, and trust issues.

Additionally, logistics managers lack proper insights into driver performance, delivery delays, and overall operational efficiency. Manual tracking methods result in errors, inefficiencies, and higher operational costs.

To remain competitive, logistics companies need a centralized CRM-based solution that can manage shipments, track drivers, calculate delivery performance, and automatically notify customers about real-time shipment status
